# Inefficient MongoDB Aggregation Pipeline
This repository demonstrates an inefficient MongoDB aggregation pipeline and provides a more efficient solution.

The original pipeline uses an unnecessary `$project` stage to rename the `_id` field, which impacts the overall efficiency.
The improved pipeline directly utilizes the `_id` field, eliminating unnecessary stages and enhancing performance.
